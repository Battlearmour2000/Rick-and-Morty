# Rick and Morty Character Viewer

![Project Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Description

The Rick and Morty Character Viewer is a simple web application that utilizes the Rick and Morty API to display characters from the show along with some details about them. This project was built using React and React Query, making it easy to fetch and display character data from the API.

This was my first time working with APIs and my first project with it. You can use this as a template for your other simple API related projects.

This [video](https://youtu.be/NQULKpW6hK4?si=_IPgS47bLcCCLu0N
) properly explains what the code does exactly and is what I used to make this project.

It is super easy to follow as long as you know basic Java Script.

Enjoy!
